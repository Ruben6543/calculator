	<h2>Welcome to the UGR Community Blog</h2>
	<p>
		The <strong>UGR Community Blog</strong> is a web platform designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, art, science, and experiences among members of the University of Granada. This project arises in response to the need to create an open digital space where students, professors, and administrative staff can share valuable content without the traditional barriers of registration and authentication.
	</p>

	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		Our mission is to develop a modern, accessible, and user-friendly web platform that allows the University of Granada community to share knowledge collaboratively, fostering academic and cultural exchange among its members.
	</p>

	<h2>What We Offer</h2>
	<h3>Democratized Content Publishing</h3>
	<p>
		We believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone. That's why we allow any member of the university community to submit articles without needing to create an account. This eliminates entry barriers and encourages participation from all corners of our academic community.
	</p>

	<h3>Quality Content Guarantee</h3>
	<p>
		All published content goes through a moderation process to guarantee quality and compliance with community guidelines. Our team of moderators reviews each submission to ensure it meets our standards for accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness.
	</p>

	<h3>Organized by Categories</h3>
	<p>
		We organize content into thematic categories to facilitate navigation and discovery:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Science</strong> - Research findings, scientific discoveries, and academic studies</li>
		<li><strong>Literature</strong> - Literary reviews, creative writing, and book discussions</li>
		<li><strong>Programming</strong> - Tutorials, coding tips, and technology insights</li>
		<li><strong>Medicine</strong> - Health information, medical research, and wellness topics</li>
		<li><strong>Art</strong> - Visual arts, music, theater, and creative expressions</li>
		<li><strong>Opinion</strong> - Personal perspectives, editorials, and thought-provoking pieces</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Community Interaction</h3>
	<p>
		Our platform fosters interaction by allowing readers to comment on articles and share them on social media, creating an active and participatory community where ideas can flourish and discussions can thrive.
	</p>
